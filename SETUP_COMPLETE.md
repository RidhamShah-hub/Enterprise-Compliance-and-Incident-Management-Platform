## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Continue Development:

1. **Start the development environment:**
   ```bash
   # In VS Code, run the task: "Start Development Database"
   # Or manually:
   docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Run the backend API:**
   ```bash
   # In VS Code, run the task: "Run Backend"
   # Or manually:
   cd backend/ComplianceAPI
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Run the frontend:**
   ```bash
   # In VS Code, run the task: "Run Frontend"
   # Or manually:
   cd frontend/compliance-ui
   ng serve
   ```

4. **Access the applications:**
   - Backend API: http://localhost:5000
   - Swagger UI: http://localhost:5000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:4200
   - MailHog: http://localhost:8025

### Immediate Development Tasks:
1. **Implement remaining services** (UserService, IncidentService, etc.)
2. **Create Angular components** for login, dashboard, incidents, compliance
3. **Add database seed data** for initial testing
4. **Implement proper error handling** and validation
5. **Add unit and integration tests**
6. **Create database migrations** with Entity Framework

### Architecture Highlights:
- **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns
- **JWT-based authentication** with role-based access control
- **Normalized database design** with audit trails
- **RESTful API** following OpenAPI standards
- **Modern Angular** with reactive patterns
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment
- **Enterprise security** best practices

The foundation is solid and ready for feature development! 🏗️
